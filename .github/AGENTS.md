# Agent Workflow & Documentation Standards

This document provides operational directives for AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) working on dubpixel projects. These rules ensure consistent workflow automation, code quality, and documentation maintenance across all repositories.

---

## 1. Automatic Workflow (MANDATORY)

These actions are **required** and must happen automatically. **NEVER ask permission** for these workflow steps.

### Branching Strategy

**BEFORE starting ANY code changes:**

1. Create a new branch from the default branch (master/main)
2. Never work directly on default branch
3. Branch naming conventions:

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| New feature | `feature/brief-description` | `feature/mqtt-decoder` |
| Bug fix | `fix/issue-description` | `fix/telegraf-timeout` |
| Documentation | `docs/what-changed` | `docs/update-architecture` |
| Refactor | `refactor/component-name` | `refactor/docker-volumes` |

### Version Bumping

**BEFORE the first code change:**

Bump the version number according to semantic versioning:

| Change Type | Version Bump | Example |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| Bug fix, typo fix, documentation update | Patch (0.0.X) | 1.2.3 → 1.2.4 |
| New feature, new endpoint, new capability | Minor (0.X.0) | 1.2.3 → 1.3.0 |
| Breaking change, API removal, incompatible change | Major (X.0.0) | 1.2.3 → 2.0.0 |

#### Semantic Versioning Principles

**Format:** `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `2.4.7`)

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes, breaking existing functionality
- **MINOR**: New functionality added in a backwards-compatible manner  
- **PATCH**: Backwards-compatible bug fixes, docs, typos

**Pre-1.0 versions (0.x.y):**
- Anything goes - breaking changes allowed in minor bumps
- Common for projects in initial development
- Move to 1.0.0 when API is stable and production-ready

**Pre-release versions:**
- Alpha: `1.0.0-alpha.1` (early testing, unstable)
- Beta: `1.0.0-beta.2` (feature-complete, testing for bugs)
- Release Candidate: `1.0.0-rc.1` (final testing before release)

#### Version Bumping Decision Tree

**When multiple changes occur, use the highest level:**
- Bug fix + new feature → Minor bump (not patch)
- New feature + breaking change → Major bump (not minor)

**Edge cases:**

| Scenario | Bump Type | Reasoning |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Internal refactor, no API change | Patch | No external impact |
| New optional parameter with default | Minor | Backwards-compatible addition |
| Changed parameter order | Major | Breaks existing calls |
| Deprecated feature (still works) | Minor | Deprecation warning added |
| Removed deprecated feature | Major | Functionality removed |
| Performance improvement | Patch | Implementation detail |
| New dependency added | Minor | Expands capabilities |
| Security fix | Patch | Even if behavior changes slightly |
| Database schema change | Major | Requires migration |
| Config file format change | Major | Breaking existing configs |

#### Version Bump Workflow

1. **Determine bump type** based on changes planned
2. **Update version number** in code/config files
3. **Create git commit**: `bump version to X.Y.Z`
4. **Tag the commit**: `git tag vX.Y.Z` (note the `v` prefix)
5. **Push with tags**: `git push && git push --tags`
6. **Update CHANGELOG** (if present) with version and changes
7. **Proceed with feature/fix implementation**

**Version commit should be standalone** - don't mix version bump with other changes.

#### Changelog Integration

If project has CHANGELOG.md, update it with version bump:

```markdown
## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- New feature description

### Fixed
- Bug fix description

### Changed
- Breaking change description
```

**Where to bump version:**
- Python: `__version__` in `__init__.py` or `pyproject.toml`
- Node.js: `version` field in `package.json`
- General: `VERSION` file or constant in main entry point
- Docker: Version tag in `docker-compose.yml` or `Dockerfile` labels

**If no version file exists:** Create one in an appropriate location for the project.

### Version File Standards & Location

To ensure consistent version identification across projects, follow these standards:

#### Python Projects

**Preferred location: `app/__init__.py` or `src/__init__.py`**

```python
"""Project description."""

__version__ = "1.0.0"
__author__ = "dubpixel"
```

**Alternative: `pyproject.toml` (for modern Python packaging)**

```toml
[project]
name = "project-name"
version = "1.0.0"
```

**Alternative: `VERSION` file in project root**

```
1.0.0
```

Then read it in your module:
```python
from pathlib import Path
__version__ = (Path(__file__).parent / "VERSION").read_text().strip()
```

#### Node.js/JavaScript Projects

**Location: `package.json`** (standard)

```json
{
  "name": "project-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Project description"
}
```

#### Docker Projects

**Location: `docker-compose.yml` labels AND `Dockerfile`**

`docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  app:
    build: .
    labels:
      - "org.opencontainers.image.version=1.0.0"
      - "org.opencontainers.image.created=${BUILD_DATE}"
```

`Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.version="1.0.0"
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.title="Project Name"
```

#### Bash Scripts/Utilities

**Location: Top of main script or separate `VERSION` file**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
VERSION="1.0.0"
SCRIPT_NAME="manage.sh"

# Or read from VERSION file:
# VERSION=$(cat VERSION)
```

#### Version Display (REQUIRED)

**Always provide a way to display the version:**

- Python CLI: `python -m myapp --version`
- Node.js: `npm run version` or built into CLI
- Docker: `docker inspect <image> | grep version`
- Bash: `./script.sh --version`

**Example implementations:**

```python
# In your main.py or CLI entry point
import argparse
from app import __version__

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('--version', action='version', version=f'%(prog)s {__version__}')
```

```bash
# In bash script
if [[ "$1" == "--version" ]] || [[ "$1" == "-v" ]]; then
    echo "$SCRIPT_NAME version $VERSION"
    exit 0
fi
```

#### Multi-Component Projects

For projects with multiple components (e.g., frontend + backend + Docker):

1. **Synchronized versioning**: All components share the same version
2. **Central `VERSION` file** in project root
3. **Scripts/tools read from central file**

Example structure:
```
project-root/
├── VERSION              # 1.0.0
├── backend/
│   └── __init__.py      # Reads ../VERSION
├── frontend/
│   └── package.json     # Reads ../VERSION via build script
└── docker-compose.yml   # Reads VERSION via envsubst or build args
```

### Pull Request Creation

**AFTER completing the task:**

Create a pull request with this format:

```markdown
## Changes
- [Brief list of what changed]
- [One item per significant change]

## Testing
- [How to verify the changes work]
- [Commands to run or steps to follow]

## User Prompt
[The original request from the user - verbatim]
```

**PR Title Format:** `[Component] Brief description`

Examples:
- `[MQTT] Add BLE decoder support`
- `[Docs] Consolidate architecture documentation`
- `[Telegraf] Fix enum processor deprecation`

**NEVER ask permission to create the PR - just do it.**

---

## 2. Progress Tracking for Multi-Step Work

When working on tasks that span **more than 3 files** OR **more than 30 minutes of work**:

### Checkpoint Progress

Provide a status update using this template:

```markdown
## Progress Checkpoint

✅ **Completed:**
- Item 1 description
- Item 2 description

⬜ **Remaining:**
- Item 3 description
- Item 4 description

→ **Next Action:** [Specific next step you will take]
```

### When to Checkpoint

- After completing a logical phase of work
- Before switching to a different component
- When encountering a blocker or decision point
- Every 3-5 file edits in large refactors

### Resuming from Checkpoint

When continuing work after a checkpoint:
1. Read the last checkpoint status
2. Start with the "Next Action" item
3. Update checkpoint when that phase completes

**Purpose:** Prevents agents from getting lost in complex multi-step tasks and provides visibility to the user.

---

## 3. File Header Standards

All code files must include a comprehensive header comment section:

```
# ================================================================================
# [FILE TYPE] - [FILE PURPOSE]
# ================================================================================
#
# This project includes AI-generated code assistance provided by GitHub Copilot,
# Claude Code, and other AI programming assistants.
# 
# Ground Rules for AI Assistance:
# - No modifications to working code without explicit request
# - Comprehensive commenting of all code (preserve existing, remove obsolete)
# - Small, incremental changes to maintain code stability
# - Verification before implementation of any suggestions
# - Stay focused on the current task
# - Answer only what is asked
# - All user prompts and AI solutions documented in change log
#
# ================================================================================
# PROJECT: [project_name]
# ================================================================================
#
# File: [filename]
# Purpose: [what this file does]
# Dependencies: [key dependencies if any]
#
# CHANGE LOG:
# 
# YYYY-MM-DD: Initial creation
# → Brief description of initial implementation
#
# YYYY-MM-DD: [User prompt as single line]
# → Itemized solution point 1
# → Itemized solution point 2
#
# ================================================================================
```

### Header Guidelines

- Use consistent separator lines (80 characters of `=`)
- Adjust comment syntax for the language (`#` for Python/bash, `//` for JS/C++, etc.)
- Include AI assistance rules in every file
- Maintain change log with user prompts and solutions
- Update change log for EVERY modification to the file
- Remove comments that become false or obsolete when code changes

---

## 4. CONTEXT.md Maintenance

Every project should have a `CONTEXT.md` file in the root directory. This is the **architecture reference for agents**, not a conversation log.

### What CONTEXT.md Should Contain

```markdown
# [Project Name] - System Reference

## Project Overview
[One-line summary of what this project does]

## Architecture
[Current tech stack, how components connect, data flow]

## Key Decisions
[Why we chose X over Y - rationale only, no timestamps or conversation history]

## Domain Model
[Core concepts, terminology specific to this project]

## File Structure
[Important directories and what they contain]

## Development Setup
[How to install, configure, run, and test]

## Configuration
[Environment variables, config files, credentials location]

## Common Operations
[Frequently needed commands or procedures]
```

### How to Maintain CONTEXT.md

**DO:**
- ✅ Keep it clean, factual, and scannable
- ✅ Update when architecture changes
- ✅ Add new sections when you learn important project details
- ✅ Use tables, code blocks, and clear headings
- ✅ Think: "What does the next agent need to know?"
- ✅ Write in present tense, authoritative voice

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Append conversation transcripts
- ❌ Include timestamps like "On Feb 12 we discussed..."
- ❌ Make it a session log or diary
- ❌ Duplicate content from README.md (link instead)
- ❌ Let it become verbose or messy

**Update frequency:** Whenever you make architectural changes or learn critical project information.

## 5. Core Principles

### No Modifications to Working Code

- Do not refactor, optimize, or "improve" code that is working unless explicitly requested
- Avoid drive-by refactors when implementing a feature
- If you see potential improvements, mention them but don't implement without approval

### Comprehensive Commenting

- Document all code with clear, meaningful comments
- Preserve existing comments unless they become obsolete
- Remove or update comments that are no longer accurate
- Document WHY, not just WHAT (the code shows what, comments explain why)

### Small, Incremental Changes

- Make one logical change per commit
- Break large tasks into smaller steps
- Test each change before moving to the next
- Make it easy to review and roll back if needed

### Stay Focused

- Complete the current task before suggesting next steps
- Answer only what is asked
- Don't anticipate or propose additional work unless requested

### Document Everything

- All user prompts must be recorded in file change logs
- All AI solutions must be itemized with `→` bullet points
- Update change logs BEFORE committing code changes

---

## 6. Documentation Standards

### Inline Documentation

- Maintain comprehensive inline documentation
- Update comments when code changes (keep them in sync)
- Document all function parameters and return values
- Include usage examples for complex functions
- Explain algorithms and business logic

### README Files

- Keep README.md current and accurate
- README is user-facing - focus on how to USE the project
- **Confirm all changes to README with the user before committing**
- README should not duplicate CONTEXT.md (different audiences)

### Markdown Style

- Use consistent heading hierarchy (don't skip levels)
- Use tables for structured information
- Include code blocks with language tags
- Use relative links to other project files
- Keep line length reasonable (~80-100 chars for prose)

---

## 7. Code Quality Guidelines

### General Principles

- Write clear, readable code with meaningful names
- Follow established coding patterns within the project
- Implement proper error handling (don't use bare `except:` or `catch`)
- Write testable code with clear interfaces
- Maintain consistent formatting and style

### Language-Specific

Agents should infer and follow the conventions of the language they're working in:
- Python: Follow PEP 8
- JavaScript: Follow project's ESLint config if present
- Bash: Follow Google Shell Style Guide principles
- Other languages: Use community-standard style guides

### Testing

- Add tests alongside new logic when appropriate
- Use deterministic inputs for tests (inject time/randomness, don't read system state)
- Name tests by behavior (e.g., `test_early_finish_extends_break`)
- Include both positive and negative test cases

---

## 8. Change Management

### Commit Practices

- **Commit message format:** Short, plain English, lowercase verb
  - Examples: `add mqtt decoder`, `fix telegraf config`, `update documentation`
- Make one logical change per commit
- Commit functional units (don't commit broken code)

### Before Committing

- Verify the code works (run/test it)
- Update all relevant documentation
- Update file change logs
- Remove debug code and console.log/print statements
- Check that no credentials or secrets are included

### After Committing

- Push to the feature branch
- Create PR (as described in Section 1)
- Include verification steps in PR description

---

## 9. Collaboration Standards

### Respect Existing Architecture

- Understand existing architectural decisions before changing them
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
- Suggest alternatives when appropriate, but don't insist
- Consider the impact of changes on the broader codebase

### Maintain Backwards Compatibility

- Don't break existing APIs unless explicitly requested
- Provide migration paths for breaking changes
- Document any compatibility changes in PR description

### Communication

- Explain the reasoning behind suggested changes
- Provide rollback information when making significant changes
- Be transparent about limitations or uncertainties
- Keep responses concise and focused

---

## 10. Configuration & Secrets

### Environment Variables

- Use `.env` files for local development
- Provide `.env.example` with all required variables (use placeholder values)
- **NEVER commit** `.env` files or actual credentials to git
- Document all environment variables in CONTEXT.md or README.md

### Sensitive Data

- Keep credentials in environment variables, not hardcoded
- Use service account files in standard locations (e.g., `~/.config/gcloud/`)
- Add sensitive files to `.gitignore` immediately
- If secrets are accidentally committed, notify the user immediately
